Personal security advisor for your Android device

Security Guard protects you from various security threats, ranging from vulnerabilities in apps and weak privacy control to phony applications and other issues.

This application is <i>not</i> a piece of anti-virus software that wants to scare you so that you spend (more) money on your digital protection.

Instead, it gives you leverage and helps you take your mobile protection into your own hands.

It's important to know that, even with the most expensive apps for mobile security, you don't automatically get perfect protection.

The only chance to be <i>really</i> secure is knowing how things work, adjusting settings and reviewing apps â€” Security Guard will help you.
